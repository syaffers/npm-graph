# npm-graphs
Some visualizations on data I mined months ago on NPM, the Node.js package manager.
Since I wanted to look at how developers create packages,I set out to see how
decoupled some packages are. I scraped the whole npmjs.com site and took along all
the dependencies of each package. At the time there were 141702 packages, each with
varying amounts of dependencies. Naturally, this is a graph problem which requires
some visualizations to help understand the relations better.

I'm still mining this and creating cooler graphs. Do visit now and again.
